                                                CIBIL scores aren't always required while you are applying for a loan. One of the several perks of subscribing to an online gold loan is that it does not require a stellar credit history. The borrower's credit score is not an integral element of the eligibility criteria. All one requires to avail of a gold loan is collateral and a few basic KYC documents. The said basic documents comprise of basic identity and address proof. Sometimes, lenders even approve loans just based on the Aadhar Card. On the other hand, in the case of an unsecured loan, the borrower has to submit their CIBIL score as a mark of their financial health.
